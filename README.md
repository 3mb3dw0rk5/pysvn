# PySVN - The pythonic interface to Subversion

The PySVN project's goal is to enable Tools to be written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) that use [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) source control system.

Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other unix platforms are supported.

### Features of the PySVN Python extension

- Supports the majority of svn client features.
- Supports svn transaction features required to write svn pre-commit hooks.
- Easy to learn and use.
- Python like interface.
- Good Documentation and examples.
- No need to understand the Subversion C API. 

## Latest Version

PySVN 1.9.10 supporting Subversion 1.12.0 and earlier.

PySVN supports Python 3 as well as Python 2.

Prebuilt kits are available for Windows and Mac OS X.

The [downloads](https://pysvn.sourceforge.io/downloads.html) page for details of the available kits for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

## Documentation

The [PySVN Programmer's Guide](https://pysvn.sourceforge.io/Docs/pysvn_prog_guide.html) is a good place to get started using PySVN.

It covers the use of PySVN in a tutorial style with lots of examples.

Use the [PySVN Programmer's Reference](https://pysvn.sourceforge.io/Docs/pysvn_prog_ref.html) to look up the detailed descriptions of all the classes, functions and variables of PySVN.

The python-library/site-packages/pysvn/Examples/Client/svn_cmd.py program is a replacement for the svn command line written using PySVN. It is a good place to look for working examples of use of all the pysvn module. View the latest version of [svn_cmd.py](https://github.com/3mb3dw0rk5/pysvn/blob/master/Examples/Client/svn_cmd.py).

## PySVN App

[SCM Workbench](http://scm-workbench.barrys-emacs.org/) is an App for Mac OS, Windows and Linux/Unix that provides Subversion, Git and Mercurial access. It is the replacement for the PySVN Workbench app.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to PySVN with ideas, code, testing and documentation.

Discussions take place on the pysvn-discuss [mailing lists](https://sourceforge.net/p/pysvn/mailman/). Feature requests, bugs and patches can be entered in the [tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/pysvn/tickets/) database.

## PySVN Project site

The main [SourceForge PySVN Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pysvn/) page has links the Issue Tracker, Code browser and other services.

## Build Dependencies

The extension is written in C++, using the [PyCXX library](http://cxx.sourceforge.net/). Everything else is written in Python.

PySVN works everywhere Python and Subversion works.
